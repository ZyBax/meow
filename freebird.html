        <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5EWPGh7jbTNO2wakv8LjUI?si=f6a10d3a7080456f">If I leave here tomorrow
            Would you still remember me?
            For I must be traveling on now
            'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
            But if I stay here with you, girl
            Things just couldn't be the same
            'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
            And this bird you cannot change
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
            And the bird you cannot change
            And this bird you cannot change
            The Lord knows I can't change
            Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah
            Though this feeling I can't change
            But please don't take it so badly
            'Cause the Lord knows I'm to blame
            But if I stay here with you girl
            Things just couldn't be the same
            'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
            And this bird you cannot change
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
            And the bird you cannot change
            And this bird you cannot change
            The Lord knows I can't change
            Lord, help me, I can't change
            Lord, I can't change
            Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
