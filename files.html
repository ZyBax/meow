        <h3>Hello! The file-sharing system here isn't that robust.
            I have to manually add files to the repo, so you'll have to email me (at meow@meow.autos) if you want to share a file here.
        I would personally recommend WeTransfer over this (https://we.tl) to share files, but to avoid the Adobe ads all the time you can email me for this file sharing service-thing.
        All content on here must follow the GitHub Acceptable Use policies (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) and I reserve the right to not host any files.
        The files also cannot go over 100MiB, or about 104MB.
        That's it.
