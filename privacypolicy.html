    <h1>Privacy Policy for meow.autos</h1>

    <h2>Last updated: October 7, 2024</h2>

    <p>At meow.autos, we take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information gathered from users who visit our website.</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>When you visit meow.autos, we may collect certain information, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Page URL</strong>: We track which specific pages are visited on our site.</li>
        <li><strong>Geolocation</strong>: If you grant permission, we collect your general geographic location (e.g., city or region).</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: If you consent through the cookie consent manager, we may collect your full IP address for geolocation purposes. If you do not provide consent, your IP address will be anonymized to protect your privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Timestamp</strong>: The date and time when a page is visited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. How We Use the Data</h3>
    <p>The data we collect is used solely for analytical purposes. Specifically, we use this data to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify which pages on our site are more popular.</li>
        <li>Analyze patterns related to the time and location of visits to better understand traffic and improve user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this data for any marketing or targeted advertising purposes.</p>

    <h3>3. No Unconsented IP Tracking</h3>
    <p>We do not track or store your full IP address without your consent. If consent is granted via the consent manager, your full IP address will be used to enhance geolocation accuracy (e.g., city or region). If consent is not provided, your IP address will be anonymized, meaning we cannot personally identify you based on your IP address.</p>

    <h3>4. No Marketing or Third-Party Sharing</h3>
    <p>The data we collect (page URL, timestamp, geolocation, and IP address if consented) is not shared with third parties for marketing or advertising. The data is purely used for internal analysis to improve our website and user experience.</p>

    <h3>5. Use of Google Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors engage with meow.autos. Google Analytics may collect data about page visits, geolocation, and timestamp. If consented, your full IP address may also be collected. For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, you can visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Googleâ€™s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>6. Cookies</h3>
    <p>Our website uses cookies to facilitate Google Analytics and to respect your consent for data collection. You will be presented with a cookie pop-up where you can agree to or decline the use of cookies, including IP address collection.</p>

    <h3>7. User Consent for Geolocation</h3>
    <p>We request permission before accessing your location. If you choose not to share your location, your browsing experience will not be affected, and we will still be able to track page visits, timestamps, and anonymized IP addresses.</p>

    <h3>8. Data Security</h3>
    <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect the data we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>

    <h3>9. Your Rights</h3>
    <p>As a user of meow.autos, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decline geolocation tracking.</li>
        <li>Opt-out of cookies that facilitate data collection by Google Analytics.</li>
        <li>Request that any data we have collected about your visit be deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10. Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data collection practices. Any updates will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it regularly.</p>
