                the not so beautiful world of the 2024 election
            </strong>
        </h1>
        <h3>I will be supporting Kamala Harris and (tampon) Tim Walz in the 2024 election.</h3>
        <h6>this will probably not come as a surprise to many of you, but if it does, then here's why:</h6>
        <br>
        <h2>I prefer democracy over dictatorship.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I believe that all of you currently reading also prefer democracy over dictatorship. Don't? Oh well. <a href="https://www.twinkl.com/teaching-wiki/dictatorship">See this.</a></p>
        <p>Donald Trump has said that he would have a dictatorship. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQkrWL7YuGk.</p>
        <p>Yes, he has also said that it would only be for day one, but can you really believe him? I mean, he still hasn't admitted that he lost the 2020 election <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iludfj6Pe7w">(which, has caused some pretty bad things to happen).</a></p>
        <p>This is, only one of my cocerns, obviously.</p>
        <p>His plans line up very similarly with Project 2025 (there's even a nice <a href="https://meow.autos/project2025">song</a>about it!)</p>
        <p>And, Project 2025 isn't too good for the future of our country (ex. many, many, anti-queer laws, practically banning abortion, and removing the checks and balances system)</p>
        <p>So, I am supporting Kamala Harris and (tampon) Tim Walz in the 2024 election, and I believe you should do so too.</p>
